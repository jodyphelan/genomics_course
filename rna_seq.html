      <h4>Transcriptomics Practical</h4>
      <h4>Introduction</h4>
      <p>An application of next-generation sequencing is <b>RNA sequencing</b> (Mortazavi et al., 2008;
        Wang et al., 2009). In particular we will discuss transcriptome (messenger RNA) sequencing.
        Transcriptome sequencing is a very useful addition to genome sequencing projects as it helps to
        identify genes and thus aids in genome annotation. In this sense, it is similar to earlier transcriptome
        sequencing using capillary methods (EST sequencing), but provides much higher coverage of the transcriptome.</p>
      <p>Reads from RNA sequencing can be treated in much the same way as those from DNA sequencing. The exception
        is in eukaryotes when there is splicing, where a single gene can code for multiple proteins through
        transcription of determined exons.</p>
      <p>Due to the vast number of reads produced by next generation sequencing technology, the transcriptome
        is also sequenced very deeply. Each gene is sequenced in proportion to its abundance and the large number
        of reads means that even low abundance genes are sequenced to some extent. This means that expression
        levels of genes can be compared. One can visualise the "pile up" of reads in a particular region by looking
        at coverage plots. The higher the signals in the plot, the more expressed a transcript is. It is important
        to note that the sequences originate from transcriptome samples (mRNA) and therefore only contains information
        about the exons and untranslated regions (UTRs).</p>
      <p>Imagine the following transcript is present in the sample:</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="img/rnaseq_1.png" class="img-fluid"></div>
      <p>Reads belonging to the transcript are produced by the sequencing process. When the reads come out as raw
        data, there is no information about where they belong in the reference genome. Furthermore, all reads from
        several different transcripts come out together. An alignment algorithm localises them in the reference
        genome based on similarity matches.</p>
        <div class="text-center"><img src="img/rnaseq_2.jpg" class="img-fluid"></div>
      <p>In the plot, the coverage line represents the number of reads that align to the genome at each base position.
        This allows us to identify coding regions, here, the 3 exons (in yellow) that comprise the transcript above.</p>
      <p>In this module we will use a similar approach used to map DNA sequencing data to map RNA sequencing data from
        <i>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</i>.</p>
      <p>Understanding an organism's genome goes beyond cataloging the genes that are present in the genome. Insight into the
        biological stages in which each gene is expressed (potentially used) helps us to identify how organisms develop and respond to a particular external stimuli.
        The first layer of such complex patterns involves the understanding of how the genome is being used is the transcriptome.
         This is also the most accessible type of information because, like the genome, the transcriptome is made of nucleic acids
         and can be sequenced relatively easily. Arguably the proteome is of greater relevance to understand cellular biology,
         but it is chemically heterogenous making it much more difficult to assay.</p>
      <p>Over the past two decades, microarray technology has been applied extensively for addressing the question of which
        genes are expressed and when, enabling the performance of <b>differential expression analysis</b>. Despite its
        success, this technology is limited in that it requires prior knowledge of the gene sequences for an organism
        and has a limited dynamic range in detecting the level of expression, e.g. how many copies of a transcript are
        made. RNA sequencing technology using, for instance Illumina HiSeq machines, can sequence all the genes that
        are transcribed, and the results have a more linear relationship to the real number of transcripts generated.</p>
      <p>The aim of <b>differential expression analysis</b> is to determine which genes are more or less expressed in different
        situations. We could ask, for instance, whether a bacterium uses its genome differentially when exposed to stress,
        such as heat or challenged by a drug. Alternatively, we could ask which genes make human livers different from
        kidneys.</p>
      <p>In this exercises, we will try to gain some understanding of differences between <i>M. tuberculosis</i> lineages.
        The genome of <i>M. tuberculosis</i> was published in 1998 (Cole et al., 1998). It has 4.4 Mb and a high GC
        content (~65%), comprising 4,111 genes. Although the variability of the <i>M. tuberculosis</i> genome has been
        considered limited, it has been demonstrated a higher diversity than it was previously thought. Currently, <i>
        M. tuberculosis</i> is classified in 7 different lineages with a different geographical distribution, and
        also virulence or spreading capacity has been seen to vary between lineages. Strains from different lineages have
        shown differences in virulence or in acquisition of drug resistance (Parwati et al., 2010), and these differences might
        be caused by variable expression of determined genes.</p>
        <p>Therefore, the aim of this session is to become familiar with the
        steps carried out in transcriptomics studies, from mapping RNA-seq reads to the performance of differential expression
        analysis.</p>

          <h4>Exercise 1: Mapping RNA-seq with BWA</h4>
          <p>First, we will map RNA sequence reads from a <i>M. tuberculosis</i> lineage 1 strain to the reference
          genome, in this case, the H37Rv <i>M. tuberculosis</i> strain.</p>
          <p>You can find the <i>M. tuberculosis</i> H37Rv reference genome (called <i>H37Rv.fa</i>) as well as the two files
            of RNA-seq reads from a lineage 1 strain (<i>Mtb_L1_1.fastq</i> and <i>Mtb_L1_2.fastq</i>) in the transcriptomics
            directory.</p>
          <p><b>Running BWA</b></p>
          <p>To work with the command line of Linux, you will need to open a terminal, activate this practical's <code>conda</code> environment, and go to the data and
            transcriptomics directory:</p>
          <pre><code>conda activate rnaseq && cd ~/data/transcriptomics</pre></code>
          <p>And list the files there:</p>
          <pre><code>ls</pre></code>
          <p>You will find there the 4 fastq files, 2 of them from the lineage 1 sample, and the reference genome fasta file; these
            are the input data for this practical.</p>
          <p>For the mapping, first an index of the reference genome must be constructed with bwa index. On the command
            line, you should type:</p>
          <pre><code>bwa index H37Rv.fa</pre></code>
          <p>This will generate 5 files which are needed for BWA. We will then align the RNA-seq reads to the
            reference genome with bwa mem. We will therefore use the reference genome (in fasta format) and the two
            fastq files that contain the RNA-seq reads, saving the output to a SAM file. To start you should type:</p>
          <pre><code>bwa mem H37Rv.fa Mtb_L1_1.fastq.gz Mtb_L1_2.fastq.gz > ./Mapping_Mtb/Mtb_L1.sam</pre></code>
          <p>The output will be located in the <i>Mapping_Mtb</i> folder, which is in the transcriptomics directory.</p>

        <h4>Exercise 2: Converting BWA SAM output to BAM and indexing</h4>
          <p><b>SAM to BAM using samtools</b></p>
          <p>The details of where each <i>M. tuberculosis</i> read has been mapped are now stored in a file in the
          directory <i>Mapping_Mtb</i>. We are going to view the mapped reads in Artemis using the Artemis BAM view. However,
          the mapping result is not currently in BAM format. To make a BAM file from the BWA output we need to run
          a short series of programs.</p>
          <p>To convert the BWA output SAM file to BAM format we are going to use samtools. First, we go to the directory
          where the output file from the BWA is and we will transform the sam file to bam (as we are already in the Transcriptomics
          directory we just need to type):</p>
          <pre><code>cd ~/data/transcriptomics/Mapping_Mtb
samtools view -b Mtb_L1.sam > Mtb_L1.bam</pre></code>
          <p>Once we have the BAM file, we need to sort it and index it. To do it, we will use samtools sort and
          samtools index commands:</p>
          <pre><code>samtools sort -o Mtb_L1.sorted.bam Mtb_L1.bam
samtools index Mtb_L1.sorted.bam</pre></code>
          <div class="alert alert-warning">What does the parameters -b in samtools view and -o in samtools sort mean?
          </div>
          <p>To see the list of options and parameters for the commands, type:</p>
          <pre><code>samtools view
samtools sort</pre></code>
          <p>Now we are going to save our sorted file as <i>Mtb_L1.bam</i> and <i>Mtb_L1.bam.bai</i> for the index one.</p>
          <pre><code>mv Mtb_L1.sorted.bam Mtb_L1.bam
mv Mtb_L1.sorted.bam.bai Mtb_L1.bam.bai</pre></code>
          <p>The resulting bam and index files will then be in the folder <i>Mapping_Mtb</i>. The alignment output could
          now be visualised in Artemis, Tablet or a visualisation tool of your choice.</p>

        <h4>Exercise 3: Visualisation of the BAM files</h4>
          <p>Now we will examine the reads mapping in Artemis using the BAM view feature.</p>
          <p><b>Viewing the mapped reads in Artemis</b></p>
          <p>Open Artemis (type <i>art</i> in the terminal) and select: 'File', 'Open Project Manager', select '+' to add a new project you can call "Mtb"
            and load <i>H37Rv.fa</i>, which contains the reference genome. We need also to add the genome features, so we can see the gene models. For
            doing so, we will load the <i>Mtb.gtf</i> file (is in the <i>transcriptomics</i> directory) as the annotation track. Select 'annotation'
            and then press 'new property'.</p>
          <div class="text-center"><img src="img/rnaseq_3.png" class="img-fluid"></div>
          <p>Now select 'open' and the artemis window should appear. From the Artemis 'File' menu, select 'Read BAM/VCF', and then select the
            bam file you just generated from the L1 <i>Mtb</i> sample (i.e. <i>Mtb_L1.bam</i>).</p>
          <p>You should see the BAM window appear (shown in the screen shot below). We want to change the view in order
          to better see how the reads map to the genome.</p>
          <div class="text-center"><img src="img/rnaseq_4.png" class="img-fluid"></div>
          <p><b>Interpreting the mapping</b></p>
          <p>This exercise is similar to the one performed before in the Visualisation module. Scroll along the genome
            and examine the read coverage (the part of the genome mapped goes from position 2420631 to 2920631. To view
            that part select 'Goto', 'Navigator' and write in 'Goto Base' 2420631). Notice how different genes have
            different depths of coverage.</p>
          <div class="alert alert-warning">Why do some genes have little or no coverage?</div>
          <div class="alert alert-warning">Why do some reads map where there are no genes?</div>
          <div class="text-center"><img src="img/rnaseq_5.png" class="img-fluid"></div>
          <p><b>Including more lineages</b></p>
          <p>One interesting feature of the Artemis viewer is the possibility to see more than one BAM file at the same
            time, which enables to comapre coverage from different samples. Hence, next we want to include more lineages,
            in this case we will add another sample belonging to the lineage 4 of <i>Mtb</i>.</p>
            <div class="alert alert-info">
              <p>To do it, we will need first to follow the previous steps in order to get the sorted and index bam
            files. Therefore, map it with BWA as before, the fastq files are in the directory <i>transcriptomics</i>
            and are called <i>Mtb_L4_1.fastq</i> and <i>Mtb_L4_2.fastq</i>.</p>
            </div>
          <p>Once we have the bam files, we can add it to the viewer.</p>
          <div class="text-center"><img src="img/rnaseq_6.png" class="img-fluid"></div>
          <p>In the BAM view of the reads, it might be difficult to distinguish the differences between the BAM files.
            However, in the coverage plot, one can see the differences in coverage.</p>
          <p>One reason to perform RNA-seq under different conditions or in different samples (in this case different
            lineages of <i>Mtb</i>), is to see genes that are differentially expressed. For example, one gene may be more highly
            expressed in one lineage that in the other.</p>
          <div class="alert alert-warning">Can you find any genes that have differential expression?</div>
          <div class="text-center"><img src="img/rnaseq_7.png" class="img-fluid"></div>
          <p>Now go to gene Rv2161c (position 2422271).</p>
          <div class="text-center"><img src="img/rnaseq_8.png" class="img-fluid"></div>
          <div class="alert alert-warning">Would you think that this gene is differentially expressed?</div>

          <h4>Exercse 4: Differential expression</h4>
          <p>There are tools that calculate the differential expression, like the R packages DESeq or EdgeR. They take the reads mapped
            to each gene, normalize the resulting quantities of mapped reads (coverage), and then estimate if any genes
            are differentially expressed. In general, the results are more credible and significant if biological
            replicates are included.</p>
          <b>Counting reads with HTSeq-count</b>
          <p>In order to perform a differential expression analysis, the first step is to count the reads mapped to each
            of the genes so that we can make comparisons between the different samples.</p>
          <p><b>HTSeq-count</b> is part of the HTSeq package which will quantify the number of reads mapping to gene
            models in different RNA-seq experiments given a file with aligned sequencing reads (the bam file obtained
            through BWA) and a list of genomic features (the <i>Mtb.gtf</i> file with the gene annotation).</p>
          <p>We will run HTSeq-count with the RNA-seq data from the L1 and L4 strains we were using in the previous
            exercises. To do it, we will go to the directory where we have the data and use the following command:</p>
          <pre><code>cd ~/data/transcriptomics
python -m HTSeq.scripts.count -f bam -r pos -s reverse -t gene ./Mapping_Mtb/Mtb_L1.bam Mtb.gtf > ./Mapping_Mtb/Mtb_L1_htseq_count.txt
python -m HTSeq.scripts.count -f bam -r pos -s reverse -t gene ./Mapping_Mtb/Mtb_L4.bam Mtb.gtf > ./Mapping_Mtb/Mtb_L4_htseq_count.txt
</pre></code>
          <p>The parameters we have used in the HTSeq-count command are:</p>
          <ul class="list-group">
            <li class="list-group-item">-f: format of the input data</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">-r: how is sorted the data</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">-s: whether the data is from a strand-specific assay. The reverse option is
              used for pair-end reads from HiSeq in order to mantain the strain-specificity (the reads have to map
              to the gene in the corresponding strand to be counted)</li>
            <li class="list-group-item">-t: feature type, in this case exon</li>
          </ul>
          <p>If you have any doubt about the parameters of the program, type:</p>
          <pre><code>python -m HTSeq.scripts.count</pre></code>
          <div class="alert alert-warning">What would -a parameter do?</div>
          <p>We can now take a look at the results from the HTSeq-count typing the following in the command line:</p>
          <pre><code>cd ~/data/transcriptomics/Mapping_Mtb
less Mtb_L1_htseq_count.txt</pre></code>
          <p>You should see two columns with the list of genes and the counts for each gene.</p>

          <p><b>Finding differentially expressed genes with DESeq2</b></p>
          <p>Now we are going to perform a differential expression analysis in order to look for genes with variable
            expression between lineages. To do it we will use 6 sequenced samples, 3 from lineage 1 and 3 from lineage 4.
            Two of them will be the two analysed in the previous steps. We are going to use an R package for the anaylsis
            of the differential gene expression called <b>DESeq2</b>.</p>
          <p>A differential expression analysis is used to compare gene expression levels, given by the number
            of reads per gene (obtained by HTSeq-count) between samples (for example, between 2 lineages of <i>Mtb</i>). In order
            to accurately ascertain which genes are differentially expressed, and the amount of expression, it is necessary
            to use replicated data. As with all biological experiments doing it once may simply not be enough. There is no
            simple way to decide how many replicates to do, it is usually a compromise of statistical power and cost.
            By determining how much variability there is in the sample preparation and sequencing reactions we can better
            assess whether genes are really expressed and more accurately determine any differences. The key to this is performing
            biological rather than technical replicates. This means, for instance in tuberculosis, growing up three
            cultures of bacteria, treating them all identically, extracting RNA from each and sequencing the three samples
            separately. Technical replicates, whereby the same sample is sequenced three times do not account for the
            variability that really exists in biological systems or the experimental error between cultures of bacteria and
            RNA extractions. More replicates will help to improve statistical power for genes that are already detected at high levels,
            while deeper sequencing will improve power to detect differential expression for genes which are expressed at low
            levels. In this exercise we will consider the 3 L1 and the 3 L4 samples as biological replicates.</p>
          <p>To start, we firstly need a table with the counts. In the <i>Mapping_Mtb</i> directory (where we should be) we can
            find a folder called <i>HTSeqCounts</i> with 6 files called:</p>
          <pre><code>cd ~/data/transcriptomics/Mapping_Mtb/HTSeqCounts
ls</pre></code>
          <div class="alert alert-info" style="white-space:pre-wrap;"><samp>Mtb_1_L4_htseq_count.txt  Mtb_3_L1_htseq_count.txt  Mtb_5_L1_htseq_count.txt
Mtb_2_L1_htseq_count.txt  Mtb_4_L4_htseq_count.txt  Mtb_6_L4_htseq_count.txt
</samp></div>
          <p>Now, to start, we need to open R in the terminal, just typing:</p>
          <pre><code>R</pre></code>
            <p>And then load the packages we are going to
            need for the analysis:</p>
          <pre><code>library(DESeq2)
library(gplots)</pre></code>
          <p>These 6 files are the results of the HTSeq-count of the two samples previously analysed plus 4 more <i>Mtb</i>
            samples we will use to perform the analysis.</p>
          <p>To prepare the data we are going to use the following scripts.</p>
          <p>First we are going to set the directory where we have the files:</p>
          <pre><code>directory <- "/home/user/data/transcriptomics/Mapping_Mtb/HTSeqCounts/" </pre></code>
          <p>And now we can select the files and save them in the variable ‘sampleFiles’ by selecting all the files
            that contain "Mtb" that are present in our directory:</p>
          <pre><code>sampleFiles <- grep("Mtb", list.files(directory), value = TRUE)</pre></code>
          <p>As we are comparing lineage 1 to lineage 4 samples, we are going to set up lineage as "condition".</p>
          <pre><code>sampleCondition <- c("l4","l1","l1","l4","l1","l4")</pre></code>
          <p>Now we construct the table with the sample information and convert it in a DESeq object:</p>
          <pre><code>sampleTable <- data.frame(sampleName = sampleFiles,
                          fileName = sampleFiles,
                          condition = sampleCondition)
dds <- DESeqDataSetFromHTSeqCount(sampleTable = sampleTable,
                                      directory = directory,
                                      design = ~ condition)</pre></code>
          <p>Before doing the analysis, we are going to filter the dataset keeping only the genes with at least 10 counts,
            so that we make sure that every gene considered for the analysis was transcribed.</p>
          <p>To do it, type the following:</p>
          <pre><code>keep <- rowSums(counts(dds)) >= 10
dds <- dds[keep,]</pre></code>
          <p>And we are going to set up the condition for the analysis in two levels which are 'lineage 1'
            and 'lineage 4':</p>
          <pre><code>dds$condition <- factor(dds$condition, levels = c("l1","l4"))</pre></code>
          <p>We can then run the differential expression anaylisis by calling the function <i>DESeq()</i>,
            which will normalise the data and compare between the two groups established (l1 and l4). We can store the
            results in a variable called 'res':</p>
          <pre><code>dds <- DESeq(dds)
res <- results(dds)</pre></code>
          <p>Let's take a look at the results. Type:</p>
          <pre><code>res</pre></code>
          <p>And you should get a table like this:</p>

          <div class="alert alert-warning">How many genes did we analysed?</div>
          <p>Let's take a look at the summary of the results we just obtained:</p>

</samp></div>
          <p>When asking whether a gene is differentially expressed we use statistical tests to assign a p-value. If
            a gene has a p-value of 0.05 we know that there is only a 5% chance that it is not really differentially
            expressed. However, if we are asking this question for every gene in the genome, then we would expect to
            see due to multiple comparison, p-values less than 0.05 for many genes even though they are not really
            differentially expressed. Due to this statistical problem we must correct the p-values so that we are not
            tricked into accepting a large number of erroneous results. Adjusted p-values are p-values which have been
            corrected for what is known as <b>multiple hypothesis testing</b>.
            <p>The summary shows us the number of genes with an adjusted p-value < 0.1 that are under or over expressed in
            one of the groups (log2FoldChange above or below 0, here represented as LFC). The adjusted p-value in the
            DESeq analysis is equivalent to the FDR or 'False Discovery Rate'. This value represents the proportion of
            discoveries that we can expect to be false.</p>
          <div class="alert alert-warning">Which is the maximum percentage of "false discoveries" that we can expect given
            a cut off adjusted p-value of 0.1?</div>
          <div class="alert alert-warning">How many genes are up and down-regulated with an adjusted p-value < 0.1?</div>
          <p>Some of the p-values in our results might be NA values, which can be due to extreme outliers. To continue with the
            analysis we are going to remove these missing values.</p>
          <pre><code>res <- res[!is.na(res$padj),]</pre></code>
          <p>Let's now order the results by p value, so we see the top genes with the highest statistial significance. Take a
            look at the results again.</p>
          <pre><code>resOrdered <- res[order(res$pvalue),]
resOrdered</pre></code>
          <p>To visualise the diffences in expression we are going to plot a heatmap using the 17 genes that are above the
            cut off. To do it, we will first get the normalised counts in a variable called "counts_heatmap". We will copy
            the names of the first 17 genes from our "resOrdered" table in a vector, and then extract the normalised
            counts from "counts_heatmap" for the 17 genes we want to plot.</p>
          <pre><code>counts_heatmap <- counts(dds, normalized = TRUE)
idx <- rownames(resOrdered)[1:17]
counts_heatmap <- counts_heatmap[rownames(counts_heatmap)%in%idx,]</pre></code>
          <p>If we type:</p>
          <pre><code>counts_heatmap</pre></code>
          <p>We can see the table with the normalised counts for each sample and each of
            the genes of our interest.</p>

          <div class="alert alert-warning">Do the samples cluster by lineage in the dendrogram?</div>
          <p>As you can see in the color key, red cells in the plot represent overexpressed genes
            whilst green ones the underexpressed genes. Rows represent the 17 genes of interest and
            columns the 6 samples we are analysing.</p>

          <h4>Further exploration</h4>
          <p><b>What do I do with a gene list?</b></p>
          <p>As we have just seen, differential expression analysis results is a list of genes which show
            differences between two conditions. It can be daunting trying to determine what the results mean.
            On one hand you may find that due to there being no real differences or there being too
            much noise in your experiment, you have no significant differences. On the other hand, you may
            find thousands of genes are differentially expressed. What can you say about that?</p>
          <p>Other than looking for genes you expect to be different or unchanged, one of the first things
            to do is look at Gene Ontology (GO) term enrichment. There are many different algorithms for this,
            but you should annotate your genes with functional terms from GO using for instance Bast2GO
            (Conesa et al., 2005) and then use perhaps TopGO (Alexa et al., 2006) to determine whehter any
            particular sorts of genes occur more than expected in your differentially expressed genes.</p>
