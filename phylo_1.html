      <h4>Objectives</h4>
	  <p>
		  By the end of this practical you should:
		  <ul>
		  	<li>Understand the relationship between genetic relatedness and transmission events.</li>
			<li>Know how to reconstruct and interpret a phylogenetic tree</li>
			<li>Understand how time and spatial diffusion of an epidemic is inferred from a phylogeny</li>
		  </ul>
	  </p>
	  <h4>Introduction</h4>
	  <p>
	  	In the lecture, we saw how epidemiological processes leave a measurable imprint on pathogen genomes sampled
		from infected individuals. These processes can be recovered from genetic data sampled at different times and
		places, using statistical inference methods that take into account the sequences’ shared ancestry.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	In this practical session, we will reconstruct and interpret the Influenza A H1N1 2009 (H1N1/09) epidemic in
		England, based on a set of viral sequences isolated during the outbreak.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	We will identify transmission chains of H1N1/09, reconstruct their migration patterns, estimate the number of
		independent introductions in England, and infer the time and geographical location of these introduction
		events. In order to do so, we will apply the following procedure:
		<ol>
			<li>We will reconstruct the phylogeny of influenza genomes sampled in England and other countries where
				H1N1 infections were diagnosed.</li>
			<li>We will apply a molecular clock model to the data in order to fit the phylogeny to real time
				scales.</li>
			<li>We will infer the migration patterns of H1N1 into and within England using Bayesian Markov chain
				Monte Carlo (MCMC) phylogeographic inference.</li>
		</ol>
	  </p>
	  <hr>
	  <h4>Section 1 - Phylogenetic reconstruction</h4>
	  <p>
	  	We will use the packages <b>AliView</b> and <b>RAxML</b> to view genetic sequence files and build a
		maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic tree.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	The file ‘<b>H1N1.flu.2009.fas</b>’ is a multi-FASTA file containing 50 full-length influenza A H1N1/09 genomes.
		These nucleotide sequences correspond to influenza viruses sampled in Canada (n = 5), China (n = 3),
		England (n = 23), Mexico (n = 4), Peru (n = 1), and the United States of America (USA; n = 14) between
		April and June 2009. The sequences are 12,735 nucleotides long.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	We will use <b>AliView</b> to manually inspect the FASTA file:
	  </p>
	  <ol>
        <li>Activate the correct environment with <kbd>conda activate phylogenetics.</kbd></li>
	  	<li>Open <b>AliView</b> by running the commmand <kbd>aliview</kbd>.</li>
      <li>Import the sequence file: <kbd>File</kbd> > <kbd>Open File</kbd>, navigate to <b><i>~/data/phylogenetics</i></b> and select the file <b>H1N1.flu.2009.fas</b>. </li>
	  </ol>
	  <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
	  	<u>Important</u>. To infer the phylogenetic relationship of a set of sequences, these need to be ‘aligned’.
		That is, nucleotide positions need to be arranged in columns to ensure that we compare homologous
		positions one to another. In evolutionary biology, homology means similarity due to descent from a
		common ancestor. Two genes are homologous if they descend from an ancestral gene. Likewise, two
		nucleotides in different sequences are homologous if they correspond to the same nucleotide position
		in the ancestral gene. Note that two objects can be ‘similar’ without being ‘identical’. The sequences
		shown here have been aligned but if your data are not, it will need to be aligned. This can be done
		in AliView, as well as in other programs including MUSCLE, ClustalW and MAFFT.
	  </div>
	  <p>
	  	The sequence alignment is displayed as a matrix, where rows correspond to viral samples and columns
		to nucleotide positions (see <b>Figure 1</b>). Cells are coloured by type of nucleotides (A, C, G or T) and
		missing information, or gaps, are indicated by a dash (“-“).
	  </p>
	  <figure>
	  		<img src="img/phylo_1_1.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
			<figcaption class="figure-caption"><b>Figure 1.</b> Nucleotide sequence alignment of influenza A H1N1 genomes (detail)</figcaption>
	  </figure>

	  <p>
	  	The unique identifier of the sequences is shown at the left hand side of the nucleotide matrix and
		contains the strain name (e.g. A/England/247/2009) followed by the date of sampling (e.g. d2009-05-31)
		in the format dYYYY-MM-DD.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	In the matrix, we can spot ‘rare’ nucleotide substitutions present in one or more sequence (scroll
		along the sequence alignment to spot some). These single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) allow us to
		identify viruses that are genetically related (they share a common SNP) and infer epidemiological linkage
		between them. If viruses sampled from different individuals have the same SNPs, we can assume that they
		form a specific strain infecting these individuals. This is the property we use to reconstruct transmission
		chains from a phylogenetic tree.
	  </p>
	  <hr>
	  <h4>Tree reconstruction</h4>
	  <p>
	  	<b>RAxML</b> [1] is a freely available software used to reconstruct phylogenetic relationships between
		individuals using a maximum-likelihood (ML) approach. This approach takes into account a substitution
		model to assess the probability of particular mutations. You can also perform bootstrapping, a method for
		validating the tree by repeating the analysis a specified number of times to produce pseudoreplicates.
		This acts as a support for the tree topology of the final tree that is produced by calculating the number of
		pseudoreplicates in which a given node of a tree is found.
	  </p>
	  <ol>
	  	<li>Open your command-line terminal and navigate to the folder containing the <b>H1N1.flu.2009.fas</b>
			sequence file.</li>
      <pre><code>cd ~/data/phylogenetics/</code></pre>
		<li>Run the following command (This may take a few minutes to complete):</li>
    <pre><code>raxmlHPC -m GTRGAMMA -s H1N1.flu.2009.fas -n H1N1.flu.2009.ML -p 11334 -k -f a -x 13243 -N 100</code></pre>
    </ol>
	  <p>
          <b>raxmlHPC</b>: This will run RAxML on the command-line and uses the following parameters:
		  <ul>

		  	<li><b>-m GTRGAMMA</b>: This sets the substitution model to be used. We are using GTR (generalised time reversible)
				with a gamma distribution.</li>
			<li><b>-s H1N1.flu.2009.fas</b>: This is your input file.</li>
			<li><b>-n H1N1.flu.2009.ML</b>: This is the name that will appended to output files.</li>
			<li><b>-p 11334</b>: This is a random seed number.</li>
			<li><b>-k</b>: Trees are printed with branch lengths.</li>
			<li><b>-f a</b>: This tells RAxML to conduct a rapid Bootstrap analysis and search for the best-scoring ML tree
				in a single run.</li>
			<li><b>-x 13243</b>: This is a random seed number for bootstrapping.</li>
			<li><b>-N 100</b>: This specifies the number of bootstrap runs.</li>

		  </ul>
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	Once the software has finished running, the file <b>RAxML_bipartitions.H1N1.flu.2009.ML</b> will contain
		the ML tree with bootstrap supports. Add the extension .tre to the file:</p>
    <pre><code>mv RAxML_bipartitions.H1N1.flu.2009.ML RAxML_bipartitions.H1N1.flu.2009.ML.tre</pre></code>
    <p> And open the tree to view in the
		program FigTree, for this run the command:</p>
    <pre><code>figtree</pre></code>
    <p>FigTree is a tree editor with a graphic interface and is freely available at
		<a href="http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/" target="_blank">http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/</a>. It runs on all operating systems.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	When prompted at opening, name the bootstrap values “bootstrap support”. You can now view the ML tree with
		bootstrap support values. Click on the <kbd>node labels</kbd> section on the left of the viewer and select <kbd>bootstrap
		support</kbd> from the <kbd>Display</kbd> drop down box. This will display the bootstrap support for each of the nodes of
		the tree. Go to <kbd>Trees</kbd> > <kbd>Increasing Node Order</kbd> to display the tree by increasing node order.
	  </p>
	  <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
	  	<u>Note</u>. many of the values shown are low (the scale is 0 [no support] to 100 [full support]). Typically
		values over 70% (in this case a bootstrap value of 70) are taken as showing strong support. Low values
		here may suggest that you need to change the substitution model or run the analysis with more bootstrap
		runs. For the purposes of time for this exercise, we will continue with the trees produced here.
	  </div>
	  <h4>Tree interpretation</h4>
	  <p>
	  	Take a few minutes to familiarise yourself with the tree.
	  </p>
	  <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
	  	<u>Reminder</u>. The components of a phylogenetic tree are shown in Figure 2. The sequences, or taxa (plural for
		taxon), are positioned at the end of the external branches. Related sequences are linked by a node (their
		most recent common ancestor). Two or more sequences descending from a node form a ‘clade’ (or cluster). The
		length of a branch represents the genetic distance between two nodes or between a node and a taxon, i.e.
		the number of mutations accumulated since divergence. The root corresponds to the common ancestor of all
		the taxa.
	  </div>
	  <p>
	  	Since the sequences represent viruses sampled from different individuals, a clade in the tree corresponds
		to a transmission chain. The number of sequences in a clade reflects the number of infections sampled
		from that transmission chain. The root of the tree corresponds to the origin of the epidemic.
	  </p>

	  	<p>Q1. How many times was H1N1/2009 introduced in England during the outbreak?</p>

	  	Q2. What is/are the most likely geographical origin of the English strain(s)?
		(Take the sampling dates into account in your reasoning)

	  </figure>
	  <h4>Dating the introduction(s) of H1N1/09 in England</h4>
	  <p>
	  	We will now estimate the time frame of these migration events. This time frame can be inferred from
		the rate at which mutations are accumulated in gene sequences. If, for instance, two sequences differ
		by 4 mutations and their rate of evolution is known to be around one substitution per nucleotide position
		per year, then 2 years have elapsed since they diverged from their common ancestor (i.e. 1 substitution
		x 2 year x 2 sequences = 4 mutations).
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	The first step of this procedure involves testing whether the genomes in the tree have evolved at a
		constant rate over time or not. This is called testing the <b>molecular clock hypothesis</b>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	If the molecular clock is constant, or <b>strict</b>, the genetic distance between two sequences will be
		proportional to the time since these sequences last shared a common ancestor (as in the example given
		above). If the molecular clock is not constant, the correlation between genetic distance and time since
		divergence is weaker. The molecular clock is then said to be <b>relaxed</b>. Assuming a strict or relaxed
		molecular clock will have an impact on the dating of phylogenetic nodes. We will therefore test the
		molecular clock hypothesis before dating the tree.
	  </p>
	  <h4>Molecular clock testing</h4>
	  <p>
	  	Open the software TempEst by running the following command:</p>
	  <pre><code>tempest</pre></code>
	  <p>
	  	TempEst [2] is a tool for investigating the ‘temporal signal’ of molecular phylogenies, i.e. testing whether
		there is sufficient genetic change between sampling times to reconstruct a statistical relationship between
		genetic divergence and time (a molecular clock) in your data. The software is freely available from
		<a href="http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tempest" target="_blank">http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tempest</a>.
	  </p>
	  <p>
	  	<u>How does it work?</u> TempEst performs ‘root-to-tip’ linear regressions, which can be used as a simple
		diagnostic tool for molecular clock models. It implies plotting the genetic divergence of the sequences
		(i.e. the sum of the branch lengths from a sequence -the tip- to the root of the tree) against the sampling
		time of the sequences (Figure 3).  A linear trend with few residuals indicates that evolution follows a strict
		molecular clock. The same trend with greater scatter from the regression line suggests that a relaxed
		molecular clock model may be most appropriate. No trend at all indicates that the data contains little
		temporal signal and is unsuitable for inference using phylogenetic molecular clock models.

      <p>
          Import the ML tree you saved earlier or, if you can’t find it anymore, select the file named
          <b>RAxML_bipartitions.H1N1.flu.2009.ML.tre</b> in your folder. If you are not prompted for the tree when
          <kbd>TempEst</kbd> opens, import it using the drop-down menu: <kbd>File</kbd> > <kbd>Open…</kbd>
      </p>
      <p>
          We now have to tag the sequences with their sampling date. A list of all the sequences in the tree will appear
          (in the default <kbd>Sample Dates</kbd> tab). In order to plot root-to-tip genetic distances against sampling
          time, each sequence has to be associated with its date of sampling. Sampling dates are indicated at
          the end of the sequences’ name, preceded by the suffix ‘_d’, in the format YYYY-MM-DD. For instance,
          the sequence named ‘A/Lima/WRAIR1687P/2009_d2009-06-27’ was sampled the 27th of June 2009.
      </p>
      <p>
          In the Sample Date tab, click on <kbd>Parse Dates</kbd>. In the <kbd>Parse Dates for Taxa</kbd> window, select
          the following options:
          <ul>
              <li>The date is given by a numerical field in the taxon label that is defined by a prefix and its order
                  (Order: <b>Last</b>; Prefix: <b>_d</b>)</li>
              <li>Parse as a calendar date (Date format: <b>yyy-MM-dd</b>)</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <p>
          Click <kbd>OK</kbd> and the time of sampling will appear in the <b>Date</b> column.
      </p>
      <p>
          Go to the <kbd>Root-to-tip</kbd> tab to see the root-to-tip linear regression plot. Check the box marked
          <b>Best-fitting root</b>. Summary statistics of the plot are shown in the left hand side window:
          <ul>
              <li><b>Date range</b>: the maximum time interval between two sampled sequences.</li>
              <li><b>Slope</b>: The slope of the regression line; corresponds to the rate of evolution, here the average
                  number of nucleotide substitutions per unit of time (here, per year).</li>
              <li><b>X-intercept</b>: the time at which the viral population had no genetic diversity,
                  which corresponds to
                  the time of the most recent common ancestor of the sampled population (tMRCA).</li>
              <li><b>Correlation Coefficient</b>: A measure of the relationship between time and the number of
                  accumulated mutations (range: -1, 1). A positive/negative value implies a positive/negative linear
                  relationship between time and diversity (i.e. as time increases, so does genetic divergence). A
                  value close to 0 suggests no relationship between time and genetic divergence.</li>
              <li><b>R squared</b>: A measure of how close the data is to the regression line, i.e. what proportion
                  of the variation in genetic divergence is explained by a strict molecular clock hypothesis.</li>
          </ul>
      </p>
      <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
          Q3. Can we assume that the rate of evolution of the viruses in the phylogeny is constant over time
          (i.e. that the molecular clock is strict)?
      </div>
      <h4>Dating migration events</h4>
      <p>
          Now that the properties of the molecular clock in our dataset have been established, we will estimate the
          time(s) at which H1N1/09 was introduced in England.
      </p>
      <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
          <u>Reminder</u>. In a ‘classic’ phylogenetic tree, branch lengths reflect as the number of nucleotide substitutions
          per site. Rates of evolution are expressed as the number of substitutions per site per unit of time. By
          dividing the length of a branch by the rate of evolution, we end up with a tree where branch lengths represent
          time units. A branch therefore represents the time elapsed between two nodes. Or, in our case, the time
          elapsed between two transmission events.
      </div>
      <p>
          The reconstruction of dated phylogenetic trees is computationally intense and could not be achieved
          within the time imparted for this practical. A dated H1N1/09 phylogeny was therefore built prior to the
          session, under the appropriate molecular clock model, using the Bayesian MCMC approach implemented in the
          software <b>BEAST</b> v.1.8 [3]. The resulting dated tree is in your folder under the name
          <b>H1N1.flu.2009.mol_clock.tre</b>. A more detailed example of how to set up a BEAST v1.8. analysis, including
          producing the input files and analysing the output is shown in the <b>Appendix</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
          <u>How does it work?</u> Each tip of the tree has a known time, given by the sampling date of the
          sequence. Internal nodes are given arbitrary starting times consistent with their order in the
          tree (from the tips to the root). An additional parameter, the evolution rate, is used to scale
          these times into expected number of nucleotide substitutions per site. Markov chain Monte Carlo
          integration is then used to summarize the probability density function of a model tested against
          the data, providing a representative sample of parameter values of the chosen model. The model
          includes the tree topology, the times of internal nodes and the evolution rate.
      </p>
      <p>
          We will use the program <b>FigTree</b> to display the dated tree and its annotations.
      </p>
      <p> Open <b>FigTree</b> by running the command:</p>
      <pre><code>figtree</pre></code>
      <p>
          Import the dated tree: <kbd>File</kbd> > <kbd>Open…</kbd> > <b>H1N1.flu.2009.mol_clock.2.tre</b>
      </p>
      <p>
          A phylogeny will appear. Again, go to <kbd>Tree</kbd> > <kbd>Increasing Node Order</kbd> to display the tree in the same way
          as the one you generated with RAxML. This will ease comparison. Note that the major clusters do not change,
          just the order in which the clusters are organised from top to bottom. The dated tree should be very
          similar to the ML tree you reconstructed in Session 1. However, in this tree, the branch lengths represent
          days rather than genetic distances. Notice the scale at the bottom of the tree.
      </p>
      <p>
          On the lefthand side toolbar, tick the <kbd>Node Labels</kbd> box. The age of the nodes will appear.
      </p>
      <p>
          The age of a node is expressed as the number of days prior to the most recent sampling date in the tree.
          Here, the most recent sample is A/Lima/WRAIR1687P/2009, sampled on the 27th of June 2009. If, for instance,
          a node age equals 21 days, it means that the date at this node is the 6th of June 2009.
      </p>
      <div class="alert alert-warning" role="alert">
          <p>Q4. According to the molecular clock dating, what are the date(s) of introduction of H1N1/09 in England (rounded down)? </p>

      <h4>Identifying the geographical origin(s) of the H1N1/09 strains imported in England</h4>
      <p>
          We will finally reconstruct the migration pathways of these H1N1/09 strains.
      </p>
      <div class="alert alert-primary" role="alert">
          <u>Reminder</u>. When individuals are infected in one location and then move to another, or infect someone
          whilst travelling, this is apparent as a “change” in the location ascribed to one branch of the tree. These
          changes in location along a phylogenetic tree can be inferred from the location values at the tips and the
          shape of the tree (see Figure 4). To do so, a model of location exchange process is fitted to the data and
          the most likely location of the viral strain positioned at the nodes of the tree, together with its probability,
          can be estimated using a MCMC sampling procedure similar to the one used in Section 2.

      <h5>Phylogenetic tree building with BEAST</h5>
      <p>
          Note: This is an example of initializing a BEAST v.1.8. analysis only, BEAST2 is a re-write of BEAST v.1.#. and
          will have a different interface.
      </p>
      <p>
          1. Creating a BEAST input file using BEAUti
      </p>
      <p>
          XXX Launch BEAUti by typing beauti into the command line or by opening the BEAUti program from the dashboard.
          BEAUti is the program used to create .xml files that are used as the input to BEAST.
      </p>
      <p>
          1.1. Load in the FASTA sequence file <b>H1N1.flu.2009.fas</b> by clicking the <kbd>+</kbd> button on the bottom
          left, or by clicking: <kbd>File</kbd> > <kbd>Open…</kbd>
      </p>

      <p>
          This first will give you information on the number of taxa (50), the number of sites (12735), and the data
          type (nucleotide).
      </p>
      <p>
          If you want to partition the data, i.e. if you have samples that you know are from different populations
          or lineages, you can go onto the ‘Taxa’ tab and set these partitions. This will allow you to specify whether
          these groups are monophyletic as well as divergence dates between groups. For this exercise, we will not
          assume any partitioning of samples.
      </p>
      <p>
          1.2. Attach a date to each of your samples.
      </p>
      <p>
          This can be done in the same way as was shown in TempEst:<br>
          In the Tips tab, tick the box for <b>Use tip dates</b>’, and then click on <b>Guess Dates</b>. In the <b>Guess
          date values for all taxa</b> window, select the following options:
          <ul>
              <li>The date is given by a numerical field in the taxon label that is defined by a prefix and its order (Order: <b>Last</b>; Prefix: <b>_d</b>)</li>
              <li>Parse as a calendar date (Date format: <b>yyyy-MM-dd)</b></li>
          </ul>

      </p>
      <p>
          Alternatively, you can create a tab-delimited file (.txt) with two columns corresponding to the taxa names
          and sample dates, and use <b>Import Dates</b>.
      </p>
      <img src="img/phylo_1_6.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
      <p>
          1.4. Set the location for each sample.
      </p>
      <p>
          To attach further traits to each sample, such as location, in the <kbd>Traits</kbd> tab, click on <kbd>Import Traits</kbd> and
          open a tab-delimited file (.txt) with two columns corresponding to the taxa names and location (or
          characteristic of choice).
      </p>
      <p>
          1.5 Set a site (substitution) model.
      </p>
      <p>
          This allows us to substitution and site heterogeneity models. The rate and likelihood of base substitution
          over the genome will be variable so we will set some parameters to describe the model of substitution.
          We will set the <b>substitution model</b> to <b>GTR</b> – Generalized Time Reversible model – as this is the most
          frequently used model and allows for variable base frequencies. It is also reversible (i.e. T->A same rate as
          A->T). We can also set the site heterogeneity model, i.e. the frequency of each site to a <b>Gamma</b> distribution
          with 4 categories.
      </p>
      <p>
          In the Sites tab, select <b>GTR</b> from the ‘<b>Substitution model</b>’ dropdown box. We will set the ‘<b>Site Heterogeneity
          model</b>’ as ‘<b>Gamma</b>’ with 4 categories.
      </p>

      <p>
          1.5 Set a clock model.
      </p>
      <p>
          The ‘<b>Clocks</b>’ tab will allow us to set the molecular clock for mutations along each branch of the tree. If
          we set this to ‘<b>Strick clock</b>’ this specifies that the mutation rate along each branch will be invariable.
          As we have shown in the TempEst analysis that our data varies significantly from a strict molecular clock,
          we will select a relaxed clock to allow for rate variation across branches in our tree.
      </p>
      <p>
          In the Clocks tab, select ‘<b>Uncorrelated relaxed clock</b>’ from the ‘<b>Clock Type</b>’ dropdown box and keep the ‘<b>Relaxed Distribution</b>’ option as ‘<b>Lognormal</b>’.
      </p>
      <img src="img/phylo_1_8.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
      <p>
          1.6 Set a tree model.
      </p>
      <p>
          As the phylogenetic tree is built through a coalescent approach, backwards through time based on the genetic
          diversity at tips/samples, you can will need to set a model for the demographic history of the population
          that describes the effective population size through time. For example, ‘<b>Constant size</b>’ will state that the
          effective population size has remained constant through evolutionary time. For the purposes of this exercise,
          we will choose a constant population size.
      </p>
      <p>
          In the <kbd>Trees</kbd> tab, select ‘<b>Coalescent: Constant Size</b>’ from the ‘<b>Tree Prior</b>’ dropdown box.
      </p>
      <p>
          <i>Note: You can also input a starting tree on which BEAST will base the topology of the Bayesian tree. This may
              be a neighbor-joining or parsimony tree and can speed up the analysis by approximating the topology as a
              prior. We will start with a random tree.</i>
      </p>
      <p>
          The ‘<b>States</b>’, ‘<b>Priors</b>’ and ‘<b>Operators</b>’ tabs allow us to specify whether to reconstruct sequences, set
          specific priors for each parameter, and to specify which operators to include in the output log file.
          We will leave all these as default values.
      </p>
      <p>
          1.7 Define the length of the MCMC chain
      </p>
      <p>
          Finally, the ‘<b>MCMC</b>’ tab is where we will define the steps in the MCMC chain that is used to construct trees.
          Here we are interested in the length of the chain. This is the number of iterations (number of steps in the
          random walk) the program will go through to converge on the best tree topology. The higher this number, the
          more support there will be for the final tree and the more chance of convergence.
      </p>
      <p>
          Define the length of the chain by typing '<b>10000000</b>' in the '<b>Length of chain</b>' box.
      </p>
      <p>
          The name of the output files can be specified here. This will determine the names of the files that will be created
          after the BEAST run, .log, .trees, and .ops. The output file from BEAUti will be a <b>.xml</b> file for BEAST input. We
          will call this H1N1.flu.2009, so type this in the ‘<b>File name stem</b>’ box, if it doesn’t already appear there.
      </p>
      <img src="img/phylo_1_9.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
      <p>
          The click on the <kbd>Generate BEAST file</kbd> button at the bottom right of the screen to generate the .xml file that will be used as the input for BEAST.
      </p>
      <h4>2. Running the BEAST analysis</h4>
      <p>
          BEAST can be run on the command line or through the desktop application. We will run BEAST on command line.
      </p>
      <p>
          To run BEAST, open up a terminal and make sure you are in the folder containing your .xml file from the BEAUti output and type:
      </p>
      <pre><code>beast H1N1.flu.2009.xml</code></pre>
      <p>
          This will create three files; .log, .trees, and .ops, with the “H1N1.flu.2009.” prefix.
      </p>
      <h4>3. Evaluating your BEAST run</h4>
      <p>
          Open the program TRACER by typing <kbd>tracer</kbd>. This will allow you to check the output from BEAST and
          determine how effectively the MCMC has mixed, i.e. how close it is to reaching a steady state (converging).
          This can be used to manually evaluate the performance of the BEAST run.
      </p>
      <p>
          Load in the ‘<b>H1N1.flu.2009.log</b>’ file to Tracer to see the output.
      </p>
      <img src="img/phylo_1_10.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
      <img src="img/phylo_1_11.jpg" class="img-fluid" alt="Responsive image">
      <p>
          Here we want to look at the <b>ESS score</b>. This is the Effective Sample Size, which is a measure of the number
          of effectively independent draws from the posterior distribution that the Markov chain is equivalent to.
          Low scores are highlighted in red, with scores >200 considered sufficient to demonstrate good mixing.
      </p>
      <p>
          To increase ESS scores, you can run the analysis for longer (more MCMC iterations), or do multiple
          independent runs that can be combined with the program <b>LogCombiner</b>. Very low scores for many parameters
          may though suggest that the prior parameters are not a good fit and should be varied.
      </p>
      <p>
          In our data, we can see that most values are over 200, with only the prior and posterior values highlighted
          in red. Looking at the “<b>Trace</b>” of the MCMC though, we can see that it remaining reasonably steady around
          -19600 for the prior parameter, suggesting that this support will increase (ESS will increase) if the
          MCMC chain was longer.
      </p>
      <p>
          4. Producing a single phylogenetic tree
      </p>
      <p>
          The program <b>TreeAnnotator</b> summarises the sample of trees produced by BEAST (in the .tree file) onto a
          single maximum clade credibility tree. The posterior probabilities of the nodes in the target tree, the
          posterior estimates and HPD limits of the node heights and (in the case of a relaxed molecular clock model)
          the rates, are shown.
      </p>
      <p>
          Load in the ‘<b>H1N1.flu.2009.trees</b>’ file to TreeAnnotator through <kbd>Choose File…</kbd> in “<kbd>Input Tree File</kbd>. Select what to the call the output file, e.g. <b>H1N1.flu.2009.tre</b>
      </p>
      <p>
          You can also set the number of burnin states (The number of initial MCMC runs to discard).
      </p>
      <p>
          Then select <b>Run</b> to produce a single maximum clade credibility tree.
